   <h2>position: static;</h2>
   <p>An element with position: static; will follow the normal flow of the page:</p>
   <div id="divstatic">
     This div element has <code>position: static;</code> and will follow the normal flow of the page
   </div>
   <h2>position: absolute;</h2>
   <p>An element with position: absolute; is free of normal flow restrictions</p>
   <div id="divabsolute">
     This div element has <code>position: absolute;</code> and is positioned absolute to the viewport; therefore, normal flow rules do not apply
   </div>
   <h2>position: relative;</h2>
   <p>Non-relative (aka static) element would appear just below this paragraph:</p>
   <div id="divrelative">
     This div element has <code>position: relative;</code> to the position where it would bein a normal flow; it can of course go left, right, up and down to this position.
   </div>
   <h2>position: fixed;</h2>
   <p>Fixed element is glued to edges of the viewport, regardless to how you change the viewport or scroll. </p>
   <div id="divfixed">
     This div element has <code>position: fixed;</code>.
   </div>
